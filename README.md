# Production Line Tracker

This project was created as a final project for Object-Oriented Programming (COP 3003), Fall 2019. According to the problem statement for the project, I was hired to create software which would allow a media player production facility to keep track of what products are being produced.<br />
We were given an outline of exactly what we were expected to do for this project [here](https://sites.google.com/site/profvanselow/course/cop-3003/oop-project?authuser=0).
